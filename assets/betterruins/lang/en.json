    "lore-wolfstone-piece1": "The partially ruined castle of Wolfstone had a rich history that began centuries ago when it was merely a single square tower, built to oversee the valuable mines in the surrounding area. The tower was constructed with great care, as the mines were vital to the region's economy and safety. Over time, the tower proved to be a sturdy structure, and it withstood the test of time and the elements.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, the tower was gifted to a newly risen baron for his accomplishments in some war. The baron was grateful for the gift and worked hard to expand the tower into a fully-fledged castle, adding a moat and sturdy walls to protect the area. The castle continued to evolve and expand under the descendants of the original baron as the mines grew ever more prosperous.\r\n\r\nThe castle was named after a pack of wolves that lived in the surrounding area, which were revered by the local people for their fierce strength and resilience. Thus, the castle became known as Wolfstone, a name that would endure for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThe last lord of Wolfstone was an avid reader and writer, who spent many hours pouring over the vast collection of books in the castle's library. He was a learned man, with a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the world around him. He often spent long hours reading by the fire, lost in thought as he pondered the mysteries of life.\r\n\r\nDespite his love of books, the last lord of Wolfstone was also a fierce warrior who led his people bravely in battle. He was a just and fair ruler who cared deeply for his people and worked tirelessly to ensure their safety and prosperity. However, despite his best efforts, the castle eventually fell into disrepair, as the mines began to dry up and the surrounding area became less prosperous.\r\n\r\nToday, the partially ruined castle of Wolfstone stands as a testament to a bygone era, a reminder of the rich history and traditions that have shaped the world around us.

    "lore-darkheat-piece1": "Entry I:\r\n\r\nI arrived with the intention of studying the reported meteor impact in this region. The land bears the scars of something violent. The soil is fractured and dry, and the tall stone formations surrounding the site are scorched black along one side, as if seared by intense heat. Near the center of the impact, I discovered a fragment lodged shallow in the ground. It was metallic, dark, and strangely smooth. Despite lying exposed to wind and weather, it remained warm to the touch.\r\n\r\nEntry II:\r\n\r\nI carried the object up into a cave-in high among the stone formations. The space is narrow but stable and offers shelter from the elements. I cleared a section of flat ground and built a small working area. The object now rests on a stone slab. The air around it grows warmer at night. It emits no light and no sound, only a steady heat that lingers without source.___NEWPAGE___",

When enclosed in a clay box, the heat intensified. It appears the relic stores or radiates energy and responds differently when confined. I began to build a more solid containment chamber within the cave to better observe these effects.\r\n\r\nEntry V:\r\n\r\nThe new chamber was completed and fully sealed for the first time this morning. I had hoped to observe a slow increase in heat, but the results were far more severe. Within hours, cracks formed through the stone. A low vibration began, not audible but felt through the floor. Before I could react, the relic released its energy.___NEWPAGE___",

I was thrown against the cave wall, and my left leg was pinned beneath loose stone. It took time to free myself. My arm is burned, and my movement is limited. The relic now lies half-buried again, resting silently in the debris. The warmth is gone. It is cold to the touch. Whatever energy it once held has been fully released.\r\n\r\nFinal Entry:\r\n\r\nI cannot remain here. My supplies are low, my wounds are worsening, and the fever has begun to rise. I have hidden my notes behind a loose stone near the back wall of the cave, wrapped tightly in cloth. The object remains where it fell, lifeless now yet still unlike anything I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nI will try to make it to the next village on foot. It lies several days away.",

    "lore-lastwall-piece1": "This weathered section of wall once belonged to a fortified town that stood along a river known for its abundant fish stocks. The settlement grew around its fishing trade, with small boats lining the shore and smoke rising daily from curing houses. The town gained modest influence through its trade, and its stone walls were built both for defense and as a symbol of endurance.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications served a real purpose. Raids, shifting borders, and local conflicts were constant risks. The wall bore the marks of many sieges and repairs. Chipped stone, scorched areas, and makeshift reinforcements revealed a long history of hardship and resilience. Each layer of stone reflected the labor of those who lived and struggled there.\r\n\r\nOver time, the town fell into decline. Trade routes changed, fish stocks began to fade, and failed harvests weakened the community. A local power struggle among nobles drained what little stability remained. With fewer people to maintain it, the town slowly emptied. Homes collapsed, and the walls crumbled one section at a time.\r\n\r\nToday, this lone fragment is all that remains. The stones lean unevenly, worn by wind and rain, and covered in moss and lichen. Near the base, a faint carving of a fish, once the town’s emblem, is still just visible. There are no grand myths or forgotten beasts tied to this place, only the quiet memory of a town that once was.",

    "lore-lastfisherman-piece1": "If these words are ever found, let them serve as a record of what became of our town. I was a fisherman. I lived by the river, cast my nets at dawn, and fed my family with what the water gave. Ours was a modest life, but a good one, built on hard work and quiet pride.\r\n\r\nThe wall outside once stood tall, raised in times of trouble when raids were common and protection was scarce. We built it ourselves, stone by stone, because no one else would. For a while, it kept danger out. But walls do not stop hunger, nor cold, nor the slow grinding weight of abandonment.\r\n\r\nFirst came the poor harvests. Then the fish began to vanish, as if the river had grown tired of feeding us. Merchants stopped passing through, and the town’s market fell silent. What little grain we had was taken as tax by men who rode in, gave no names, and left with full carts.\r\n\r\nMany left, hoping to find work or shelter elsewhere. The rest of us stayed, bound by habit or hope. I stayed because this was my home. But today, I laid down my nets for the last time. There is no more to catch. My hands shake from hunger, not age.\r\n\r\nI write this now with what little strength I have left. The hearth has gone cold. The roof leaks when it rains. Outside, the wall still stands in part, though it leans now, overgrown and cracked. The aged flags on the wall showing our successful past.\r\n\r\nWhen I close this book, I will sleep. And on the next morning I will pass on and look for a new home, leaving this to be reclaimed by nature.",

It was a marvel to behold, with its imposing square shape surrounded by a deep moat and guarded by four mighty towers, each standing tall and proud in its own right.\r\nThe Wycliffe family, a powerful and influential clan, were the lords of Glimmershield during the early centuries.\r\nTheir castle was the envy of all who laid eyes upon it, a true testament to their wealth, power, and prestige.\r\nThe castle walls were adorned with sculptures and paintings, each one more exquisite than the last.

Within the castle's armory, weapons and armor were stored, enough to equip an entire army of 200 soldiers. The Wycliffe family was a force to be reckoned with, and they knew it.\r\nOutside the walls of the castle, the Wycliffe family's lands stretched far and wide, and it was a sight to behold. Large orchards and gardens could be seen in all directions, carefully tended to by the family's servants and laborers. It was a symbol of their power, a testament to their rule over the land.\r\nHowever, as with all great things, Glimmershield's glory eventually came to an end. After the death of Earl Edmund Wycliffe, the castle sat empty for many years, falling into disrepair as the family struggled to maintain their power and influence.___NEWPAGE___",

Many of them died within the castle walls, their bodies left to rot in the dungeons and forgotten corners of the castle.\r\nIn the end, it was said that it was the prisoners themselves who set fire to the castle, reducing it to ruins and ash. Today, only the left wing of Glimmershield Castle remains, a stark reminder of the family's once-powerful rule and the tumultuous events that led to its destruction.                     ",

    "lore-fieldengineersdiary-piece1": "Vol. 1 (1/4)\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty of keeping a personal journal on this expedition; there are many aspects of field work that are not covered in the standard paperwork from the Association. I will be adding to this document on a monthly basis; all aspects of the work that are deemed “too personal” or “not relevant to the Association’s mission and values” should be recorded, regardless of the opinions of stuffy paper pushers and the restrictions of financial contracts. Jonas himself was a man of the earth, and did not restrict his genius to the confines of prewritten boxes and bureaucracy; neither shall I. That being said, this journal will never find its way to the desk of the Association out of fear of my project losing its funding. Some rules must be followed.\r\n\r\nIn the event that my work is deemed unfit for public access, I will detail the basics here: I am working on improving the stimulus-response matrix of Locusts; specifically, a way for a trained individual to modify their behavior on the fly, without needing to recalibrate the main interface. My focus will be delving into the “personality” of Locusts; the further these machines get from the capital, the stranger their behavior comes, but I believe that this can be fine-tuned to be an asset for unusual applications of Locusts. I have traveled for several weeks to a remote, back-water flax farming community, and brought with me a prototype Locust hive with abnormal behavioral modifications to experiment with on these simple people.              \r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-fieldengineersdiary-piece2": "Vol. 2 (2/4)\r\n\r\nIt has been one month since my last entry, and I have settled as comfortably as I can in this community. It is astounding how these people get by with such simple tools and structures; it’s like going back in time. The people are kind enough, but suspicious of my work; they have never seen the incredible feats Locust-assisted work can reach. I should be done setting up the prototype hive in about a week, and then I will set them loose into the flax fields. The locals have been made aware of this, and their opinions on the matter have also been made clear: Split right down the middle. Some fear the little machines, and others are excited for their release.\r\n\r\nOne notable example of an excited local is a little girl, who spends more time in the woods collecting spiders than running through the streets chasing toys with the other children. She has stopped by my lab on several occasions, and has made numerous comments on how similar Locusts are to the little insects she collects in the forest. She even brought one to me, trapped in a jar, and asked me if the Locusts would get along with it when “they are let out of their cage”. As I peered at the little creature in its jar, it stared back at me with an eerie awareness. Creepy child and pet notwithstanding, her interest in the project could prove useful for public relations, so I have been welcoming and tolerant of her incessant questioning.              \r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-fieldengineersdiary-piece3": "Vol. 3 (3/4)\r\n\r\nThe Locusts’ release was a success! The people were initially skeptical, and some even frightened of their skittering visage, but this was soon forgotten as the little marvels cleared entire fields of weeds, chased out rats, hung wires and rope from hard-to-reach places, and various farmers picked favorite Locusts for difficult tasks. “Like having an extra set of magic hands”, one said, as he pointed a Locust to the top of the windmill, hanging some twine lined with flowers for a festival. The once harsh life of a rural flax farmer has been turned into a life of fresh air, festivals and bountiful harvests. The modified behavior matrix has worked very well; I have nicknamed this particular variation “Auxilio Canis”, for their pack mentality and helpful, predictive behavior.\r\n\r\nA notable side effect of this behavior matrix, which for some ungodly known reason is not a fillable box in the traditional report paperwork, is that when a Locust is not performing a duty, and also not exposed to bright light, they sometimes crouch down and… Stare at people. Typical Locust behavior dictates that when in an idle state, they are supposed to seek out the nearest human and run their task prediction protocol to assist them. And while the Locusts are very busy and helpful during the day, I find that many of the Locusts simply watch me as I take my evening stroll. Verbal commands snap them out of it, so it’s likely a bug in their matrices, but I wanted to jot it down here just in case. There’s nothing quite like having dozens of little yellow pinpricks in the dark, following you from the alleys and crates, with no sound to break the spell but the screaming of crickets and the clacking of little metal legs on gravel just out of sight.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Association deemed the new behavior matrix a success, and a copy of the schematics was sent back to the capital for distribution. I left a handwritten note in my report about the unusual behavior in low light conditions, but it’s unlikely that it will survive the bureaucratic process. I will be heading back to the Association within the week; I can’t say I won’t miss this little village stuck outside of time. Witnessing the simple life was a breath of fresh air, and I hope that I will have another opportunity for similar field work.              \r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",

It all fell apart so quickly; it only took them a single night to wrap everyone in wire, strapped to their beds, mouths full of sawdust. All that saved me was taking a slightly different route than I usually do on my evening walks. From my hiding spot in the windmill, I can see the barbed wire spring trap they laid for me. All those nights of those little monsters staring at us from the dark… They were watching us. Learning. Feigning obedience to breed complacency. I watched them drag everyone from their homes, one by one, and string them up from buildings and lampposts like mayflies. It was brutally efficient; I am reminded of the fates of the rats that they practiced on. What fools we were, to tamper with sentience. What a fool I was, to give them agency. To teach them how to learn. They have learned that we are no longer necessary.              \r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",

    "lore-lostdoll-piece1": "In the twilight of a decaying world, a lone figure had barricaded himself in the top floor of a small, crumbling house. Outside, the Rot swept across the land like a ravenous plague, leaving nothing but death and despair in its wake. The once vibrant village below was now a graveyard of twisted bodies and guttural screams, overrun by monstrous beasts birthed from the Rot.\r\n\r\nHe had sought refuge in the attic, the final sanctuary from the horrors below. Desperation had driven them upward, he and his daughter, scrambling to escape the relentless advance of the Rot. But fate had been cruel. As they ascended the ladder, she had slipped. He reached out, but it was too late. The Rot beasts were upon her, their grotesque limbs dragging her into the darkness. Her piercing scream was seared into his mind, a relentless reminder of his failure.\r\n\r\nNow, all that remained of her was her doll. A simple thing, with button eyes and a stitched smile, it had been her constant companion. He held it tightly, the fabric worn and stained. He placed it by the attic door, as if the inanimate guardian could ward off the inevitable.\r\n\r\nDays turned into a blur of hunger and despair. He rationed what little food he had left, but it was never enough. The gnawing hunger twisted his insides, a constant, agonizing reminder of his slow demise. His strength ebbed away, replaced by a hollow, aching emptiness that gnawed at his sanity.\r\n\r\nThe light from the single window grew dimmer each day as the Rot consumed everything outside. The sounds of chaos and slaughter below were a constant reminder of the relentless threat. The house creaked and groaned, the air thick with the stench of decay and death.\r\n\r\nMemories of his daughter tormented him, vivid and cruel. Her laughter, her playful antics, the way she clutched her doll to her chest at night. These memories were a double-edged sword, offering brief solace while simultaneously deepening his grief.\r\n\r\nAs his body weakened, his mind began to fracture. The line between reality and nightmare blurred. The attic felt like a tomb, cold and suffocating. He lay down on the hard, splintered floor, the doll pressed to his chest. His breaths came in ragged gasps, his vision swimming with shadows and phantoms.\r\n\r\nIn those final, torturous moments, the doll's stitched smile seemed to mock him, a cruel jest at the futility of his struggle. But he had no strength left to fight. His eyes closed, and he surrendered to the darkness, the doll's unblinking eyes the last thing he saw.\r\n\r\nThe world outside continued its descent into chaos, but in that forsaken attic, guarded by the last remnant of his daughter's innocence, he found a brutal, cold end. The doll stood vigil, a silent witness to the tragedy, forever guarding him in the stillness of death.                  \r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",

Falco and his friend went in for a look, didn’t say a word, just grabbed their lanterns and went exploring. They came back after a while, looking pale.

The other scholar didn’t say much, but he looked relieved when we started setting charges. I asked Falco if it was really necessary, and he just nodded, looking off toward the dark. There’s something he’s not saying, something both of them saw down there that spooked them. I didn’t press him. Figured maybe it was best left alone.___NEWPAGE___",

Lined our pockets with gold as we taxed those that crossed through the canal junction for all that they could afford to miss, and with an inland route so much swifter than on foot or by carriage, many of the high-profile traders would opt for our canals over the beaten path. Things were looking good and would only get better from here.\r\n\r\nBut then, why do good things never last!? \r\nI am uncertain still what Grand Architect Faulkner had been shouting from under that air vent. A warning, something about a quarantine, and an instruction to order the servants to bury the tool sheds that lead deeper underground, after which he had hastily scurried off. I did recall having felt the ground quake two hours or so earlier when I found a group of disgruntled merchantmen on my doorstep. They said that they had crashed their skiff into a large pile of rubble blocking the canal into the Waterways, damaging the ceramics they were meaning to sell. \r\n\r\nThe wounds they had suffered were evidence enough, and I did not wish to further strain relations. Elewyn’s father had put full faith into Faulkner for all of his life and now I shall do much the same.

I hire daytalers to drag their vessels out of the water and transport their goods overland and throw them a little gift of gold for their time because I understand they value theirs as much as I value my own, and more than that I understand the value of maintaining relations with traders. I can hear my partner in life and in business, dearest Elewyn, speak to them even now, reassuring them that everything will return to normal.\r\n\r\nI was taught not to explain why the Waterways were off limits, because those traders are a persistent people, and they would see every reason presented as a challenge to argue against… though I did hear some speak with great disgust of a plague of Rot spreading across the lands. I will choose to believe it is merely a tale.\r\nI am doing everything according to my mother’s lessons, but I must admit doubts are creeping in. Five times now have I tried to seek contact at the grates, but I could never see another across it.

I had smelt death before, and now it was staring me in the eyes. It was looking at me. I think it tried to vocalize, but all I heard was the horrid wail of scraping metal against stone as it reached out through the grate to claw at me. Fearing for my own life, I ran and commanded our last remaining servant to shovel soil unto the grate until it drowned out the noise. I understand what this meant, the weight of my request. Whatever remained alive down there was going to suffocate. At this point it was a small mercy. The most I could do for them still.\r\n\r\nThe memory is not leaving me. Worse yet, I know it did not mean to hurt me, that thing.

It will be easier to sleep here than to travel daily. The workers look and act like ants, when viewed from above, and I their conductor.\r\n\r\nRaw materials flow generously into the site from our suppliers, and calloused hands assemble them into walkways and scaffolds at unprecedented speeds.

It was certainly an effective way to shut things down. But I would like to take back what I wrote earlier. I have no respect for the Blackguard anymore. Only reverence, and healthy fear. \r\n\r\nI have felt watched as of late. Of course, all the quarantined look to me for a solution! It is my duty to deliver them a cure and their subsequent freedom, for I am the one that damned them to this fate. But the feeling of their hopeful eyes pleading me for aid does not leave me anymore. Even within the walls of my chambers I can still sense their gaze resting on me, from the moment I shut that door behind me. I can work like this no longer.

Some of them, anyway. I rappelled down the edge of the crater into the shallowest tunnel, navigating the winding hallways until I found myself in what was left of a so-called Scriptorium. I can’t make sense of most of these diagrams, which tells me plenty in of itself; these people were messing with forces far beyond our comprehension, and my suspicion was swiftly confirmed as I approached the portion of the room that had been severed by the crater. Along its edge, tomes and scrolls were suspended in the air, floating. Where much of the parchment in the rest of this Scriptorium had yellowed with age, the pages of these books were a pristine white still. I did not dare further interact. Apparently I had the gift of self-restraint that these people had lacked.\r\n\r\nThat is something I would have liked to believe, and perhaps I did, at least until I heard a horrifying noise deeper into the complex and realized I had not bothered to pack a weapon. Not that I would ever willingly engage one of those monstrosities given the choice, but… well, I thought it best to head back towards the entrance. The noise did not seem to follow me, thank God, but as I stood at the entryway I heard the scraping of metal against stone out of a corridor marked Brickworks. For how foolish I was to head down unarmed, I wasn’t foolish enough to let these automatons overrun this facility in my absence, so I took to barricading the hallway.

Without it, every instruction, revision and authorization must crawl along the roads by courier, and nothing moves with the urgency this project requires.\r\n\r\nI know better than to try to repair such a delicate device myself. That engineer Helen Shelley will need to come over again, and somehow I feel like the Svanmarck Estate has their hands full with the Rot on their own. It’s their roads the plague travels across, anyway.\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard foremen aren’t working their miners nearly hard enough and there is not enough coal for our Claw & Fang contact to divert to our warehouse unnoticed. We cannot fire the engine without fuel, and we cannot proceed with the prototypes until we generate enough power. I would almost think not all those working under our banner are as devoted to House Goldfinch as myself… and I would be happy to make an example out of them, could I afford to miss any hands working on this project. Unfortunately we are pressed for time, and for now these transgressions must go unpunished.\r\n\r\nWe have painstakingly agreed to purchase it directly from the Blackguard, but given the staff we need to send to fetch the coal and the tardiness of the miners we have half the personnel and no fuel to make progress with for days, if not weeks. Nevermind the serfs that will have to be disposed of at the gate if they catch the Rot…\r\n\r\nAt least this delay will let me go over the plans again and write up my report. I have directed the rest of my staff to aid the horticulturists in their efforts; I have received word of similar setbacks upon the surface, and I would like to dedicate myself wholly to my research… I find myself annoyed at how much time is lost managing others’ failures instead of dedicating myself to my craft.___NEWPAGE___",

I came from a proud line of masons, myself, but I take pride in stonework that can stand the test of time, not whatever novel trinket most impresses Gage Goldfinch.\r\n\r\nI must remain in their good graces, though.

It does not need to be profitable.\r\n\r\nThat said, you are already aware that our houses have carried with them an unresolved matter for some time now. Your secondary objective is to retrieve the Authoritative Copy of a trade agreement made between the former matriarchs Gertrude Goldfinch and Anastasia of Svanmarck. It is believed to be contained within a wax-sealed brass scroll case as was standard Undland practice at the time.\r\n\r\nEnclosed with this letter you will find a document. It is a report of the failed Hunt by your wildfolk colleagues, commissioned at the time of the Undland Arbiter’s disappearance. Use it to determine where the Authoritative Copy was lost.\r\n\r\nIt will also make plain the degree to which the Svanmarck Estate has wronged us, and why I am so intent on seeing this noble dispute settled. They have won over us in court with a forgery of the agreement and demanded unreasonable tolls to use the roads on our own lands for many years now.\r\n\r\nThe Copy will allow us to force arbitration anew and strip the Estate of its standing.\r\n\r\nHouse Svanmarck will continue to observe our operations. Treat their auditors as collaborators, not adversaries. Any overt conflict would defeat the purpose of this venture. If staff is lost and retrieval proves impossible without drawing attention, abandonment of the site is preferable.\r\n\r\nWith golden grace,\r\nGage Goldfinch\r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",

No getting that back without putting our own lives on the line, and you’re not paying us enough to.\r\n\r\nWe dealt with the rest of them cleanly. Guards, attendants, the whole lot.

I will admit to some relief at finding nothing of particular note. The operation is exactly as it claims to be; a modest halite and potash site, competently run, and of no especial interest to the Svanmarck Estate beyond its continued compliance.\r\n\r\nI cannot help but remark on the figures. The costs of operation appear to outweigh the returns by a comfortable margin. I imagine this would be far more concerning if House Goldfinch were not so well-positioned elsewhere. Still, it is curious to see a noble house expend this much effort for so little gain. I can't say I miss the days where old Gertrude stood at the head of your House, but the Goldfinches were certainly more of a force to be reckoned with during that time. It's no matter. I know you have enough in your coffers to survive until Gage finally grows up.\r\n\r\nThe access roads remain in good condition, thanks in no small part to Svanmarck maintenance. Given the remoteness of the site, I would encourage a greater appreciation for the infrastructure that allows materials, equipment and workers to reach it all. Without our continued oversight, I suspect operations here would be considerably more difficult.\r\n\r\nConditions underground are adequate, if somewhat lax. Drainage channels have been cut with great enthusiasm and too little care, and several supports show signs of wear. I recommend addressing these issues in due time, though I trust you understand that any major improvements to access or reinforcement will require coordination with the Estate, and may not be prioritized given broader regional needs.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the quarry presents no cause for concern. It is dull, inefficient, and largely beneath notice. I see no indication of secretive extraction of rare metals as my superiors had suspected, and no reason for further scrutiny at this time. Do extend my regards to your workers.

If anybody finds this, I am starting to travel eastward looking for other survivors, and I ask you to follow me.\r\n\r\nIndrinaak\r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",
    "lore-pawprints-piece7": "Is this how the people of the Old World communicated? It feels silly, leaving notes below trees. I wonder what you would think of us, continuing your traditions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not your traditions exactly. We use your symbol now as trail markers. And we use them to exchange gifts with each-other. It’s customary to take something and leave something behind. I found my favorite toy in this cache. A clay figurine of a hound.\r\n\r\nSome of us use them as places of worship. Hard to find churches on the road! My Nana taught me to always carry a knife on my person, to touch up the carvings when I can. I reckon this was important to you. I hope that someday when I’m gone, those that come after me will look after what I left behind, as well.\r\n\r\nAmah\r\n\r\n___NEWPAGE___",

    "dialogue-strategy4.2": "Im quite busy at the moment sorry. Maybe another time.",

    "dialogue-globediscussion1": "Is there something of significance,\nsomething that has caught your attention?",
    "dialogue-globediscussion2": "Indeed, my friend. Look here, at this specific mark. It seems deliberate, unlike the usual cartographic details. It appears to point to a grand structure - a university, if the rumors are to be believed. It’s said to be nestled in a ravine, surrounded by remnants of an old village. And here...\n\n(He taps on the map with a finger.)\n\n...a tower, likely part of the university. Such places often hold secrets worth uncovering. If you’re bold enough to explore it, who knows what treasures you might find?",
    "dialogue-globediscussion3": "A university in a ravine?\nThat does sound intriguing.\nWhat could it possibly signify?",
    "dialogue-globediscussion4": "That’s the question, isn’t it? Some claim it was a place of immense learning, where scholars and visionaries gathered. Others whisper that it housed forbidden knowledge - texts and artifacts deemed too dangerous for the world outside. Whatever the truth, it has long been abandoned, and the ruins are likely teeming with opportunities for those daring enough to venture there.\n\n(He pauses, his expression thoughtful.)\n\n",
    "dialogue-globediscussion5": "I’ll need to bring this Globe to my customer, but before I do, let me copy down the markings.\n\n(The trader carefully examines the Globe, tracing the intricate details with a quill onto a piece of parchment.)\n\nThere - this map should guide you to that university. What treasures or knowledge lie there, I cannot say, but it’s bound to be worth your while. If you find anything valuable, bring it back - I’m always interested in rare artifacts.\n\n",
    "dialogue-globediscussion6": "And as promised, here's your well-earned reward of 10 rusty gears for bringing me the globe. Thank you very much!",
